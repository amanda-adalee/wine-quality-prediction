## About the Data
DATASET - The dataset used for this machine learning application was retrieved from Kaggle.com. The raw data consists of 1599 wines with twelve attributes. Eleven of which are physicochemical tests. The twelveth attribute is quality, which ranges from 0-10. For standardization purposes, wines with a rating of 7 or higher are considered high quality. Wines that are rated below a 7 are considered poor quality. The data was cleaned up by removing duplicates and outliers.

MACHINE LEARNING - A 80/20 training and testing data split was used. Two classification models were implemented, k nearest neighbor and c-support vector. The c-support vector model provided the highest classification accuracy at 91%.
